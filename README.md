# Solar System Simulator

![Simulation preview](./images/sample.png)

Simulates the motion of the solar system's planets through the implementation of an Euler integrator for the N-Body problem, using each planets' aphelion position and orbital velocity as initial parameters. 

Easily extensible - new planets can be introduced into the code by adding a new `CuerpoSistemaSolar` object in the `main.py` script. 

Project made as part of a Python workshop for astronomy university students.

## Dependencies

* `matplotlib`
